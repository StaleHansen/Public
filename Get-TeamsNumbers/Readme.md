# Find available phone numbers with Get-TeamsNumbers.ps1

I believe assigning phone numbers can waste hours for an organization with multiple ranges and locations. What if you could run a PowerShell routine to find the next available numbers in a number range and at the same time know how many numbers you have left?ðŸ˜± Now you can, with Get-TeamsNumbers.ps1.

Fun fact: this script is based on my very popular phone number management routine I crated for Skype for Business Server 2015 called Get-SfBNumbers.ps1.

Disclaimer: This tool is provided as is and you are free to re-use the routines found in the script for you own use, but should not be incorporated in commercial products without authorâ€™s consent. If you got any feedback on the script let me know on Twitter.
